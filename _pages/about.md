I am a Ph.D. student at [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Cong Fang](https://congfang-ml.github.io/). I major in artificial intelligence (AI) with a primary focus on reinforcement learning (RL). Previously, I graduated and obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from BJTU in 2023.

I am also a long-term research intern at [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://www.bigai.ai/), affiliated with Machine Learning (ML) Lab and mentored by [Dr. Qing Li](https://liqing-ustc.github.io/).

My research interests include LLM enhance rl, multi-modal learning, embodied AI, vision-language-robotics, world model, etc. My recent work encompasses developing explainable reinforcement learning decision-making systems.
